In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

select * from BIT_DB.customers limit 20;

select * from BIT_DB.FebSales limit 20;

select * from BIT_DB.JanSales limit 20;

-- Question 1 - How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

select count(distinct orderid) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question 2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(product) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
; 

-- Question 3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
on cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question 4 - Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

select distinct product, price 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price asc
limit 1
;

-- Question 5 - What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product
;

-- Question 6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product
;

-- Question 7 - How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on feb.orderid=cust.order_id
where feb.quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid<>'Order ID'
;

-- Question 8 - List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select Product, SUM(quantity), location as LA
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by Product
;
