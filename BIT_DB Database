In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

select * from BIT_DB.customers limit 20;

select * from BIT_DB.FebSales limit 20;

select * from BIT_DB.JanSales limit 20;

-- Question 1 - How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

select count(distinct orderid) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question 2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(product) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
; 

-- Question 3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

select distinct acctnum

select distinct product, price

select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product

-- Question 6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue

group by product

-- Question 7 - How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on feb.orderid=cust.order_id
where feb.quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6
