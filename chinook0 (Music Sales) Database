In this SQL project, I'm querying a relational database with multiple interconnected tables to extract key insights about customers, sales agents, invoices, and purchased tracks. 
Using structured queries, I analyze order data, customer demographics, and financial transactions to quantify statistics such as total sales, invoice counts, and distinct billing locations. 
The project involves complex joins, aggregations, and filtering techniques to ensure accurate and meaningful results."
